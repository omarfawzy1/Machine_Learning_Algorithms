# Machine Learning Algorithms Collection
This is a collection of machine learning algorithms developed using Python. The algorithms are either implemented from scratch or using popular libraries like Scikit-learn. The current collection includes the following algorithms:
<br>
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It is a supervised learning algorithm where the new instance is classified based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the training set. The value of k is a hyperparameter that is tuned to achieve optimal performance.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a simple, parametric algorithm used for predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. It is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between the input variables and output variable as a linear equation. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and output variable.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a simple, parametric algorithm used for predicting a binary output variable based on one or more input variables. It is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between the input variables and output variable as a logistic function. Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the log odds of the output variable.

## Decision Tree
Decision tree is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It is a supervised learning algorithm where the training set is recursively partitioned into subsets based on the feature that maximizes the information gain. The information gain measures the reduction in entropy after the partitioning. The resulting tree is a sequence of if-else statements that classify the new instance based on the values of its features.

## Usage
Each algorithm has a separate Python file that can be executed independently. The files are self-contained and contain examples of how to use the algorithm on sample datasets. The algorithms that use Scikit-learn require the library to be installed.

## Contributing
Contributions to this collection are welcome. If you would like to add a new algorithm or improve an existing one, please create a pull request with your changes.
